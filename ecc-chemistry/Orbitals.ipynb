    "\n",
    "Atomic orbitals are fundamental concepts in quantum chemistry and atomic physics, describing the regions in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found. Understanding the shapes and properties of these orbitals is crucial for comprehending chemical bonding, electron configurations, and the behavior of atoms in various chemical reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional methods of teaching atomic orbitals often rely on static images and mathematical equations, which can be abstract and challenging for students to visualize and grasp. However, with the advent of programming and computational tools, we can create dynamic visualizations that bring these abstract concepts to life.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module aims to leverage the power of Python programming to visualize atomic orbitals, making the learning process more interactive and engaging. By combining theoretical principles with practical coding exercises, students can gain a deeper understanding of the spatial distributions and characteristics of different orbitals."
