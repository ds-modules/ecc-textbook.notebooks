When y'all play tug of war again, they *easily* pull the rope toward themselves, making the game unfair. This kind of scenario happens in [polar covalent bonds](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/polar-covalent-bond), where for specific molecules, one atom is significantly more electronegative than the other.
