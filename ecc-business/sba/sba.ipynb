    "Small businesses serve as a core component of innovation, employment, and community development in the United States. Since its founding in 1953, the **U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)** has played a critical role in expanding access to capital by offering loan guarantees to small enterprises that may struggle to obtain funding through traditional credit markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of supporting small businesses goes beyond economics — it fosters entrepreneurship, reduces unemployment, and strengthens local economies. However, these loans are not without risk; defaults and charge-offs are also part of the picture, especially in volatile or highly competitive industries."
