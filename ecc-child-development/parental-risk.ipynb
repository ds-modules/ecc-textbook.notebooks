    "Welcome! In this notebook, we will use the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) to investigate various factors that influence pregnancy health across different states in America. You won't have to be answering any coding questions yourself in the notebooks for this class, but instead you'll be asked to answer some short-answer questions as we explore and visualize the data. Any questions you see in **yellow-shaded sections** below are questions you'll be answering! Additionally, there will be some optional questions in **blue-shade sections** that help you follow along the notebook and understand the context. We hope this notebook serves as an engaging and informative introduction to the critical role of data collection in understanding prenatal development."

This visual format allows for easy comparison of trends and differences in the selected health indicator over time between the states. By analyzing these charts, you can observe how maternal health behaviors and conditions have changed and identify any significant trends or patterns."
