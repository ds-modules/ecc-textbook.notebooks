    "Environmental justice is a crucial topic in Sociology because it highlights the intersection of social inequality, environmental policy, and public health. It supports the notion that all communities—regardless of race, income, or location—should have access to a clean and healthy environment. However, research and policy discussions have shown that pollution exposure and environmental hazards may not be evenly distributed in some places. Particularly in [LA County](http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/eh/about/environmental-justice.htm), low-income neighborhoods and communities of color are often disproportionately affected by hazardous environmenetal conditions, leading to significant health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook utilizes a data-driven approach to analyze and visualize environmental justice issues in Los Angeles County. Using statistical analysis, visualization, and geospatial data, we will explore how environmental hazards and health burdens vary across different racial groups. This analysis is essential for identifying systemic inequalities in environmental hazards exposure and can help guide effective policy interventions.\n",

    "First, we will explore a portion of the case study derived from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yakhyojon/air-quality-statistical-and-hypothesis-testing/notebook) which observes the average AQI variation across different states where Ripple Renewable Energy operates. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is the Environmental Protection Agency's index for reporting air quality. A value close to 0 signals little to no public health concern, while higher values are associated with increased risk to public health.

    "\n",
    "**How it works:** Imagine that you and your friends wonder if drinking boba regularly affects your GPA. To test this, you set up two competing ideas: the null hypothesis (H₀), which assumes that drinking boba has no effect on GPA, and the alternative hypothesis (H₁), which suggests that drinking boba lowers GPA. Next, you collect data by surveying students about how often they drink boba and their GPA. To measure whether the difference is meaningful, you set a significance level (usually 0.05, or 5%), meaning you’re okay with a 5% chance of being wrong if you claim there’s a real effect. Then, you run a statistical test, like a t-test, to compare the GPAs of boba drinkers and non-drinkers. This test gives you a p-value, which tells you how likely it is to see a difference in GPA just by random chance. If the p-value is small (≤ 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that drinking boba likely lowers GPA. If the p-value is large (> 0.05), you fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning there isn’t enough evidence to say boba drinking affects GPA.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In general, a hypothesis reframes the objective of a study as a statement, e.g., if the objective of an investigation is to determine if a food coloring is safe, the resulting null hypothesis might be “the food coloring is not safe”, or alternatively that “the food coloring is safe”\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually run hypothesis testing in terms of population distribution so as to determine whether our observation is only due to chance and that there really is no enough evidence to support our claim. Or, that we have strong evidence to support that it really is the case with very high confidence."
