More specfically, when comparing multiple groups, a series of two-sample t-tests is inefficient and increases the risk of Type I errors (false positives). ANOVA allows us to compare **more than two groups** in a single test. ANOVA checks whether the means of different groups are significantly different by comparing within-group and between-group variability.\n",
