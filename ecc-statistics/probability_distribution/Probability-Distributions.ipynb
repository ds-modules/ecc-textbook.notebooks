    "In this notebook, you learned various scenarious in which bernoulli, binomial, poisson, and geometric distributions apply. There are several others you can utilize depending on the problem you are trying to solve. The probability mass function lets you obtain the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. Additionally, you interacted with parameters for each probability distribution function to observe how they behave. "
